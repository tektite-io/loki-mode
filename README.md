## What Is Loki Mode?

Loki Mode is a multi-agent system that transforms a Product Requirements Document into a built and tested product. It orchestrates 41 specialized agent types across 8 swarms -- engineering, operations, business, data, product, growth, review, and orchestration -- working in parallel with continuous self-verification.

Every iteration follows the **RARV cycle**: Reason (read state, identify next task) -> Act (execute, commit) -> Reflect (update continuity, learn) -> Verify (run tests, check spec). If verification fails, the system captures the error as a learning and retries from Reason. This is the core differentiator: code is not "done" until it passes automated verification. See [Core Workflow](references/core-workflow.md).

**What "autonomous" actually means:** The system runs RARV cycles without prompting. It does NOT have access to your cloud accounts, payment systems, or external services unless you provide credentials. Human oversight is expected for deployment credentials, domain setup, API keys, and critical decisions. The system can make mistakes, especially on novel or complex problems.

### What To Expect

| Project Type | Examples | Typical Duration | Experience |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple | Landing page, todo app, single API | 5-30 min | Completes independently. Human reviews output. |
| Standard | CRUD app with auth, REST API + React frontend | 30-90 min | Completes most features. May need guidance on complex parts. |
| Complex | Microservices, real-time systems, ML pipelines | 2+ hours | Use as accelerator. Human reviews between phases. |

### Limitations

| Area | What Works | What Doesn't (Yet) |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Code Generation** | Full-stack apps from PRDs | Complex domain logic may need human review |
| **Deployment** | Generates configs, Dockerfiles, CI/CD workflows | Does not deploy -- human provides cloud credentials and runs deploy |
| **Testing** | 9 automated quality gates, blind review | Test quality depends on AI-generated assertions |
| **Multi-Provider** | Claude (full), Codex/Gemini/Cline/Aider (sequential only) | Non-Claude providers lack parallel agents and Task tool |
| **Enterprise** | TLS, OIDC, RBAC, audit trail | Self-signed certs only; some features require env var activation |
| **Dashboard** | Real-time status, task queue, agents | Single-machine only; no multi-node clustering |

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, Python 3.8+, macOS/Linux/WSL2, and at least one AI CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cline, or Aider).

### CLI Mode

```bash
npm install -g loki-mode
loki doctor                        # verify environment
loki start ./prd.md                # uses Claude Code by default
```

### Interactive Mode (inside Claude Code)

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
# Then type: "Loki Mode" or "Loki Mode with PRD at ./my-prd.md"
```

This is the easiest way to try it if you already have Claude Code installed. No separate `loki` CLI installation needed.

### What Happens

The system classifies your PRD complexity, assembles an agent team, and runs RARV cycles with 9 quality gates. Output is committed to a Git repo with source code, tests, deployment configs, and audit logs. The dashboard auto-starts at `http://localhost:57374` for real-time monitoring, or use `loki status` from the terminal.

**Other install methods:** Homebrew (`brew tap asklokesh/tap && brew install loki-mode`), Docker, Git clone, VS Code Extension. See [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

**Cost:** Loki Mode uses your AI provider's API. Simple projects typically consume modest token usage; complex projects with parallel agents use more. Monitor token economics with `loki memory economics`. See [Token Economics](references/memory-system.md) for details.

---

## BMAD Method Integration

Loki Mode integrates with the [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD), a structured AI-driven agile methodology. If your project uses BMAD for requirements elicitation (product briefs, PRDs, architecture documents, epic/story breakdowns), Loki Mode can consume those artifacts directly:

```bash
# Start from BMAD project artifacts
loki start --bmad-project ./my-project

# BMAD artifacts are discovered automatically from _bmad-output/
# PRD is analyzed with BMAD-aware scoring dimensions
# Architecture decisions are injected as execution context
# Epics/stories are loaded into the task queue
```

The adapter handles BMAD's frontmatter conventions, FR-format functional requirements, Given/When/Then acceptance criteria, and artifact chain validation. Non-BMAD projects are completely unaffected -- the integration is additive and opt-in via the `--bmad-project` flag.

See [BMAD Integration Validation](docs/architecture/bmad-integration-validation.md) for the compatibility analysis.

| Claude Code | `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Yes (10+) |
| Codex CLI | `npm i -g @openai/codex` | `--full-auto` | No (sequential) |
| Gemini CLI | `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli` | `--approval-mode=yolo` | No (sequential) |
| Cline CLI | `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/cline` | `--auto-approve` | No (sequential) |
| Aider | `pip install aider-chat` | `--yes-always` | No (sequential) |

Claude gets full features (subagents, parallelization, MCP, Task tool). All other providers run in sequential mode -- one agent at a time, no Task tool. See [Provider Guide](skills/providers.md) for the full comparison.
